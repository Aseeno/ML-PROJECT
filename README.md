🚀 Project Completed: Robust Data Preprocessing System 🚀

I’m excited to share my latest project where I designed and implemented a comprehensive data preprocessing system! The key objective was to address common data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise, ensuring the dataset is prepared for machine learning applications. Here’s what I accomplished:

🔍 Data Exploration:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover unique values, statistics, and patterns.
🧹 Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values, treated outliers using IQR, removed duplicates, and cleaned up inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.
📊 Data Analysis:

Filtered the dataset to derive insights, visualized relationships between age and salary, and represented population distribution by location.
🔧 Data Encoding & Feature Scaling:

Transformed categorical variables using one-hot and label encoding, followed by feature scaling with StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler for smooth machine learning integration.
This project sharpened my skills in data preprocessing, a crucial step for building reliable machine learning models! 💻
